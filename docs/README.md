Welcome to the development repo for "CesiumLink" â€” a [Cesium native API](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native#readme) integration plugin created for the Kartaverse XR pipeline.


- The Kartaverse 6 launch is planned for [Dec 24, 2024](https://days.to/christmas-eve/2024/12/24)
- CesiumLink (WIP) is being created in West Dover, Nova Scotia, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦

# Overview

[Cesium](https://cesium.com) provides an API that makes it easy to work with geospatial map data. This internet connected [GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system) (Geographic Information System) data is loaded interactively using a technology called 3D Tiles. This makes it possbile to vizualize all of planet earth, including cites, landmarks, and topography in a real-time fashion.

With the new "CesiumLink" data nodes, you can effortlessly work with 3D tile geospatial data inside your favorite node based XR toolsets. This provides artists with a high degree of control when creating and rendering digital environments.

# Broad DCC Support Planned

The new Kartaverse CesiumLink toolset is being created with the goal of initially supporting BMD [Resolve (Free)](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve)/[Resolve Studio](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve)/[Fusion Studio](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/fusion), and SideFX [Houdini Indie](https://www.sidefx.com/products/whats-new-in-h205/) (TOPs/Solaris/Copernicus) on Kartaverse 6's official launch day.
